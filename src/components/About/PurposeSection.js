              The Ceylon sapphire trade has long prized rarity, but often overlooked the importance of origin,
              and the people and places behind each stone. Arumin was created to change that.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Sri Lanka, sapphires are more than a natural resource. They are part of the islandâ€™s cultural and historical identity.
              Known as Ratnadeepa, the Island of Gems, Sri Lanka has quietly supplied the world with stones of
              remarkable quality. Yet the long-term rewards of this trade have rarely remained with those closest to it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div
            className="space-y-6 text-left text-gray-800 text-base leading-relaxed"

            <p>
              We believe there is a better way. Arumin is founded on the idea that rarity must be matched by responsibility.
              We are committed to sustainable sourcing, fair practices, and a model that strengthens the lives and economies connected to each stone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each Arumin sapphire is selected at source and cut to the highest standards. It carries not only rarity,
              but also purpose, provenance, and the spirit of its origin.
